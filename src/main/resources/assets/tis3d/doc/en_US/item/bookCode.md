The code book (or as it is sometimes referred to, the Code Bible), is the best friend of programmers working with a TIS-3D computer. It allows sketching programs in a much more comfortable manner than a simple book and quill would, allows for corrections and makes it much easier to spot potential mistakes in the code.

To obtain a copy of the code book, simply use a normal book on an [execution module](moduleExecution.md) installed in a [casing](../block/casing.md). To install a program on an [execution module](moduleExecution.md), select in in the code book, then use the code book on the [execution module](moduleExecution.md). To copy an existing program from an [execution module](moduleExecution.md) into the code book, sneak while using the code book on the [execution module](moduleExecution.md).
